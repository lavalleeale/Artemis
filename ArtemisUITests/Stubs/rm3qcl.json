They were doing this by clicking a shortcut on desktop. So &amp;quot;a friend of mine&amp;quot; changed the URL to nobraindk, i dont know if you guys know but back in the day it was a famous prank site. He also turned speaker on to max volume and also turned on the projector which projects the PC screen to a massive board. Teacher came and clicked the shortcut. The music started to playing &amp;quot;du du du dudu du du dududuu du du du dudu&amp;quot; and whole class watching 2 old fully naked gay man doing nasty things on the big screen. Also the thing with that site was you couldnt press x to quit the video or browser, it would not ever let you quit.Teacher got furious while we all laughed and had to shut the computer after multiple failed attemps to close the video. Yeah after that incident our class lost the computer for a whole year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: The video was not a hard graphic gay porn. There was nudity yeah, 2 really old guy getting or in (cant remember the scene exactly) shower while being touchy and also a really funny music accompanies them. But still it must have hurt the teachers feelings. She was really angry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {"gid_1": 1}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/rm3qcl/serious_nsfw_whats_something_that_a/hpjw6ei/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1640178617.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_rm3qcl", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/AskReddit", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1607}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "AskReddit", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "hpki6oo", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Blinkdawg15", "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_hpkd0tu", "score": 131, "author_fullname": "t2_bzmsn", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "&gt; cover the snowballs with water that would freeze almost instantly making it almost as hard as a rock \n\nHonestly at that point they're just throwing rocks with extra steps.
